### Data observations
- As in *Whelan (2013)*, clearly see convergence in buildup to Euro adoption.
- Most notable: divergence after 2010. 
- Greece throwing scale off (important) and graph cluttered but results clear.
- Worth constructing pre-1993 data (monthly as well?) to provide context for convergence. 
- Non-ECB datasources needed. Datastream?
- 4 periods: pre-EMU (not in set yet); EMS convergence period; tranquil 2000s; crisis divergence.
- Evident in shorter term yields/CDS markets? 
- Key observation for motivating paper. Clearly belief changes.
