Many recent analyses of market reactions to sovereign default risk have used credit default swap (CDS) spreads to proxy for market expectations. It is important to note that, while ostensibly determined by a similar underlying process, the evolution of CDS premia and bond yields is not identical. As outlined in  (\cite{fontana2010analysis}), the former measure suffers from several complications relating to investor risk-appetite and market liquidity that make it less suitable for drawing policy related conclusions.

\cite{kaminsky2003unholy} elements (large capital inflows, unanticipated, leveraged common creditor) apply to Greece? Intuitively yes!
