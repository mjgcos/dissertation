There has been a considerable quantity of empirical and theoretical attention devoted to macroeconomic contagion in the past few decades. 

\subsection{Pesaran and Pick methodology}

Monsoonal (global shocks), and spillover contagion are defined as `interdependence'; fundamental linkages that may or may not be observable account for the majority of the contagious comovements, which should in theory be predictable from macro fundamentals. Pure contagion, by contrast, is defined as a jump between equilibria (usually a `good' and `bad' state of the world) that is not forecastable through fundamentals alone. 

Taking Masson's definitions as standard requires a theoretical model that allows for all three methods of shock transmission between countries. Appropriate estimation of this model will
